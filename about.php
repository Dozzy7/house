                <p><i>During my four years in China i was really inspired by this quotes. </i></p></br>
                <p>“When I stand before God at the end of my life,</br>
                 I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent </br>
                 left and could say, I used everything you gave me.” </br>
                <b>– Erma Bombeck</p></br>

                <p>“Every truth passes through three stages before it is recognized.</br>
                 In the first, it is ridiculed. In the second, it is opposed. </br>
                 In the third, it is regarded as self evident.”</br>
                   <b>– Arthur Schopenhauer</b> </p>
